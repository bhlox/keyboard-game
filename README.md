# Press what you see

This project serves as a game for people who could type well with a keyboard or are trying to learn 
how to speed up their skills, or just improve their hand eye coordination with what they see on the screen without
even looking at what their hands is about to press.

## Lessons Learned

On the coding side, I get to apply all the basics of javascript.
When looking back at the code, the one thing that made a "EUREKA"
during code process, was the leaderboard functionality and how to get it working.
with that simple "SOME" array method, it got the gears rolling and that made me
feel like a genius for that day cus I know I'm gonna feel dumb again in the future with
other projects that I'm about to encounter.

On the other side(psychological), I learnt even just a bit,
that organizing that process matters. A step by step approach is
necessary. To be calm, and take a short break. And during those breaks,
I still was thinking how to solve those issues,bugs and what other features
I could put into this project, since this was gonna be my first deployment projects
and to start moving into my first framework
